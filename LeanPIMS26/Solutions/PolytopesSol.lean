Polytopes
===

Overview
===

One can represent polytopes in two ways:

- As the convex hull of finitely many points. In this case, we refer to it as a *V-polytope*.

- As the bounded intersection of finitely many closed halfspaces. In this case, we refer to it as an *H-polytope*.

These two representations are equivalent due to the *Minkowski-Weyl Theorem*.

Set up
===
For some of the definitions included here, we'll need for perform pointwise operations and use noncomputable constructions (e.g. choice). For this, we will use:
-/
open scoped Pointwise -- using `scoped` imports only the notation.
noncomputable section
/-
We'll also need to define the space in which our polytopes will live:
-/
variable {E : Type*}
[DecidableEq E] [NormedAddCommGroup E] [InnerProductSpace ℝ E] [FiniteDimensional ℝ E]
/-
This creates a finite-dimensional vector space equipped with a real inner-product and with decidable equality.
-/

/-
V-Polytopes
===
We can define V-Polytopes as a structure storing its set of generating points.
-/
structure VPolytope (E : Type*)
  [DecidableEq E]
  [NormedAddCommGroup E]
  [InnerProductSpace ℝ E]
  [FiniteDimensional ℝ E]
where
  points : Finset E
/-
Now we can add a few definitions directly associated to a V-polytope:
-/
namespace VPolytope

/-- Underlying set associated to the `VPolytope` structure. -/
def carrier (P : VPolytope E) : Set E :=
  convexHull ℝ (↑P.points : Set E)

/-- VPolytope resulting from translating `P` by vector `v`. -/
def translate (P : VPolytope E) (v : E) : VPolytope E :=
  ⟨v +ᵥ P.points⟩
/-

Proving isBounded, isConvex, isClosed
===
-/

theorem isCompact (P : VPolytope E) : IsCompact P.carrier := by
  simpa [carrier] using
      (Set.Finite.isCompact_convexHull
        (s := (↑P.points : Set E))
        (P.points.finite_toSet))

theorem isClosed (P : VPolytope E) : IsClosed P.carrier := by
  exact (isCompact P).isClosed

theorem isBounded (P : VPolytope E) : Bornology.IsBounded P.carrier := by
  exact (isCompact P).isBounded

theorem isConvex (P : VPolytope E) : Convex ℝ P.carrier := by
  simpa [VPolytope.carrier] using
          (convex_convexHull ℝ (↑P.points : Set E))

end VPolytope
/-

Halfspaces
===
We can naturally define a halfspace as follows:
-/
structure Halfspace (E : Type*)
  [DecidableEq E]
  [NormedAddCommGroup E]
  [InnerProductSpace ℝ E]
  [FiniteDimensional ℝ E]
where
  normal : E
  offset : ℝ
/-
Inside the Halfspace namespace we can define the carrier to be:
-/
namespace Halfspace

def carrier (h : Halfspace E) : Set (E) :=
  {x | inner ℝ h.normal x ≤ h.offset}

-- Exercise: Prove `isConvex` and `isClosed`. You might need to find/use some basic mathlib results.
theorem isClosed (H : Halfspace E) : IsClosed H.carrier := by
  dsimp [carrier]
  apply isClosed_le
  · exact continuous_const.inner continuous_id
  · exact continuous_const
theorem isConvex (H : Halfspace E) : Convex ℝ H.carrier := by
  dsimp [carrier]
  unfold Convex
  intros x hx y hy a b ha hb hab
  simp only [Set.mem_setOf] at hx hy ⊢
  calc inner ℝ H.normal (a • x + b • y)
      = a * inner ℝ H.normal x + b * inner ℝ H.normal y := by
        rw [inner_add_right, inner_smul_right, inner_smul_right]
    _ ≤ a * H.offset + b * H.offset := by
        apply add_le_add
        · exact mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left hx ha
        · exact mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left hy hb
    _ = (a + b) * H.offset := by ring
    _ = H.offset := by rw [hab]; ring
/-
Lean can infer how to decide equality between two halfspaces:
-/
instance [DecidableEq E] : DecidableEq (Halfspace E) := by
  classical
  infer_instance
/- We need to instanciate this typeclass in order to be able to create sets of halfspaces.-/
end Halfspace
/-

H-Polytopes
===

An *H-Polyhedron* is a finite intersection of halfspaces. An *H-Polytope* is an *H-Polyhedron* that is also bounded. In Lean, we can encode this as follows:
-/
structure HPolyhedron (E : Type*)
  [DecidableEq E]
  [NormedAddCommGroup E]
  [InnerProductSpace ℝ E]
  [FiniteDimensional ℝ E]
where
  (halfspaces : Finset (Halfspace E))

namespace HPolyhedron

def carrier (P : HPolyhedron E) : Set E :=
  ⋂ h ∈ P.halfspaces, (h.carrier)

-- We can also include theorems like `isConvex` and `isClosed` inside this namespace.

-- Challenge: Define how to translate an HPolyhedron.
def translate (P : HPolyhedron E) (v : E) : HPolyhedron E :=
  {halfspaces := P.halfspaces.image (fun h =>
        { normal := h.normal,
          offset := h.offset + inner ℝ h.normal v
        })
  }

end HPolyhedron

structure HPolytope (E : Type*)
  [DecidableEq E]
  [NormedAddCommGroup E]
  [InnerProductSpace ℝ E]
  [FiniteDimensional ℝ E]
extends HPolyhedron E where
  (bounded : Bornology.IsBounded (toHPolyhedron.carrier))
/-
An `HPolytope` will inherit definitions and theorems defined for an `HPolyhedron`.

/-
Duality
===
A key tool in prove the Minkowski-Weyl Theorem is duality.

Some version of duality is already implemented in Mathlib, but it is too general and difficult to parse for our purposes, so we implement our own:
-/
def dual (P : Set E) : Set E :=
  ⋂ x ∈ (P \ {0}), (Halfspace.mk x 1).carrier
/-
With this definition we can now prove some basic properties of duality:
-/
namespace dual

theorem isClosed (P : Set E) : IsClosed (dual P) := by
  rw [dual]
  apply isClosed_iInter
  intro x
  apply isClosed_iInter
  intro _
  exact Halfspace.isClosed (Halfspace.mk x 1)
theorem isConvex (P : Set E) : Convex ℝ (dual P) := by
  rw [dual]
  apply convex_iInter
  intro x
  apply convex_iInter
  intro _
  exact Halfspace.isConvex (Halfspace.mk x 1)

theorem zero_mem (P : Set E) : (0 : E) ∈ dual P := by
  rw [dual]
  simp only [Set.mem_iInter, Halfspace.carrier]
  intro x hx
  simp

theorem isAntitone {A B : Set E} (h : A ⊆ B) : dual B ⊆ dual A := by
  dsimp [dual]
  intro y hy
  simp only [Set.mem_iInter] at hy ⊢
  intro x hx
  have : x ∈ B \ {0} := ⟨h hx.1, hx.2⟩
  exact hy x this

end dual

/-
We can also define what the `HPolytope` that is dual to a `VPolytope` should be:
-/
def VPolytope.dual (P : VPolytope E) : HPolyhedron E :=
  { halfspaces := P.points.image (fun x => Halfspace.mk x 1) }
/-
A natural theorem would then be:
-/
theorem dual_of_VPolytope (P : VPolytope E) : dual P.carrier = P.dual.carrier := sorry

/-
Main Theorems
===
Some of the main theorems we want to prove in order to establish the equivalence between VPolytopes and HPolytope include:
-/
theorem separation_compact_closed
    {C D : Set E}
    (hC_nonempty : C.Nonempty)
    (hC_convex : Convex ℝ C)
    (hC_compact : IsCompact C)
    (hD_nonempty : D.Nonempty)
    (hD_convex : Convex ℝ D)
    (hD_closed : IsClosed D)
    (hdisj : Disjoint C D) :
    ∃ (a : E) (b : ℝ),
      a ≠ 0 ∧
      C ⊆ {x | inner ℝ a x < b} ∧
      D ⊆ {x | inner ℝ a x > b} := sorry

theorem dual_of_dual
  (X : Set E) :
  dual (dual X)
    = closure (convexHull ℝ (Set.union X ({0} : Set E))) := sorry

theorem HPolytope_is_VPolytope : ∀ P : HPolytope E, ∃ Q : VPolytope E, P.carrier = Q.carrier := sorry

theorem VPolytope_is_HPolytope [Nontrivial E] : ∀ P : VPolytope E, ∃ Q : HPolytope E, P.carrier = Q.carrier := sorry
